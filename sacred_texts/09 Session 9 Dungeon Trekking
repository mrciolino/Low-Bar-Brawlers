Session 9 Dungeon Trekking
March 4 2020

So we pick up right with Spoops exploring Allford and seems to piss off everyone and learns that the undead are hated because of a decades long conflict that ended 25 years ago called the necrotic wars and that to this day people hate the undead

All of this as Drakham and Bazzert are cornered by a pack of Spiders and Drakham justs annihilates them with his magical abilities

Then the party finds the lost halfing pickpocket and drag him along through halways of trap filled, skeeton filled danger

Os Vrntica follows up this excitement with a calming ballad which reinvigorate the party and prepares them for the rest of the dungeon, the likes of which are filled with a gelatinous cude, more spiders, and a Wall of Fire

The gang found a mysterious wall of fire and weird paintings that light up with proper activation, but before figuring out the mystery they have to deal with a mimic.

And then BOOM in from the outside and out of nowhere Krorg re-enters the fray and with a pirate crew with one goal to kill Freedom

After some introductions and re-introductions Krorg's crew dispel the wall of fire and are ready to move on to the dungeon exit.

Whats up next more spiders, Freedom, Kung Pow Chicken with a side of rice?

Who knows, Next Time on Low Bar Brawlers
