After that in the morning they move out with the caravan and run into highwaymen and instead of fighting them, our heroic party try to pay the toll by entertaining the Balk and his crew of ne'er-do-wells. Not only do they succeed, but Otto and Drakham steal 250 Gold and 5 Grenades, and Balk enjoys the performance so much that he gives a standing ovation and allows out team and the caravan to go unmolested.
