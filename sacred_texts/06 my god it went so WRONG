my god it went so WRONG
February 12 2020

First Krorg dressed up Bomb the bear to disguise him and get him in to human places

then the group heads to Kaltrosar Bay gets paid and looks for more work

goes to the castle looking for work doesn't work because Krorg brought a bear then they head to the merchant's guild get a job to clear out the sewers of Kaltrosar bay

All this while Bazzert transformed into a squirrel and infiltrated the castle

Drakham and Krorg get inside the castle with Otto, Frederina

Frederina gets arrested for touching the soft hands of the prince of kaltrosar

Bazzert screws up his disguise and get led to the dungeon

Krorg, Drakham, and Otto get a lieutenant of the guards to lead them to the sewer access in the castle's dungeon meeting up with bazzert and Fredderina

Drakham tries valiantly to unfuck the situation by persuading the guards there here to check the security of the castle and they failed by letting them in, they don't buy it.

The group gives in and is arrested then Drakham accidently kills lord Barrymoore in one hit

then more guards straight from the king of Kaltrosar, Bazzert angers the guards and They try to kill Bazzert so combat

After fighting through a large meaty man the group frees themselves, and freedom and get their stuff back and Freedom sets fire to the castle and as the group escapes they gather Os, Seiphiri, Spoops, and Kiwi and escape.

they escaped by distracting dock workers with free beer and by freeedom setting fire to the dock and everyone stowed away in cargo crates and got on a ship leaving Kaltrosar Bay

What will happen next time because I don't fucking even know and I'm the DM

You forgot the impending bear war because the king hates bears.
