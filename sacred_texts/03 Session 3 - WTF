Session 3 - WTF
January 22 2020

I dispensing with the story

the battle continued goblins died one was captured and investigtaed

bear was found guarding treasure and was suplexed into a treasure chest to contain it

goblin boss came with a badger and a cannon and killed Os Vrntica

But like the fucking gambler he is Drakham used his tides of chaos to get himself back up from death and fucked with the winds of magic and reincarnated Os Vrntica back into a high elf.

look its 1153 and I just can't even with the bad luck of 3 consecutive ones which lead to 2 people dying and then 3 consecutive crit 20s to bring everyone back to life.
