Hello Allford
February 26 2020

We get back after the pirate fight and after Freedom and Krorg jump on to a dragon turtle

The ship is still hectic and the crew and som eof the gang help out by repairing what they can and fishing up some fish for more food on the voyage to Allford

After some "hole" fixing shenanigans Os confronts the Elven task master of the ship and in fat its his cousin Eugene Vrntica though only noticing this after a short musical battle between the two

Then after a three day voyage the gang gets o Allford and immediately get referred to The West Sorea Trading Company for more work from Captain John Robin of the Seabird, but as immediately as that Otto and Frederina were pickpocketed and they were out to get their money back

After Kiwi read some thieves cant and they saw the thief head to the park and down a cave entrance then Bazzert almost set the park on fire as he produce flames while inside a bush

The gang of course put out the fire by Urinating on a bear rug and throughing it upon the burning bush

Drakham is first however in finding the thief and sneaks up on him and scares the pickpocket the corrupt guards in the thief tunnel and get the guards to point them in the direction of the thief

Down the sewer they went and through it all they all got covered in excrement and Bazzert almost killed himself and Drakham with more fire in a clod of methane above a pool of poop

After everyone getting covered in crap they found a small entrance staircase leading down and found themselves in tight corridors fighting spiders and zombies in trap filled hallways

What is next for our "Stalwart" adventurers more ASS? more GAS? more EXPLOSIONS?

Next time on Low Bar Brawlers!
